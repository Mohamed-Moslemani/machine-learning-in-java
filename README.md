## 🌠 Project Overview

This repository explores various machine learning algorithms, metrics, and utilities, all implemented in Java. With a focus on simplicity and clarity, **Machine Learning in Java** is a great resource for learning the inner workings of ML algorithms in a language not typically associated with ML. As new algorithms and metrics are added, this repository will continue to grow as a comprehensive toolkit for Java-based machine learning.

## 🔍 Key Components

Each file in this repository represents a unique machine learning algorithm, evaluation metric, or utility function, designed to be modular and reusable. Current and future contents may include:

- **Classification Algorithms**: Methods for categorizing data into predefined classes.
- **Regression Models**: Techniques for predicting continuous values.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Tools to assess model performance.
- **Utilities**: Helper functions and data preprocessing methods.

## 📄 Directory Structure

- **Source Files**: Each algorithm, metric, and utility is implemented in its own Java file, making it easy to use individually or integrate into larger projects.
- **Dependencies**: No external ML libraries are required – all implementations are built from the ground up.

## 🔧 Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Mohamed-Moslemani/machine-learning-in-java.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**

   ```bash
   cd machine-learning-in-java
   ```

3. **Compile the Java Files**

   Make sure you have Java installed, then compile the files:

   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```

4. **Run the Algorithms**

   After compiling, you can test the algorithms on sample data by creating instances in your own Java project or directly running any main class provided.
